# TP2_Mapreduce
This repository contains our work (Cyrine CHTOUROU, Mariem MEZGHANNI and Yasmine CHEIKH) done during our PLP Practical Sessions using hadoop MapReduce. 
Each of us provided the code the following parts: 

-Cyrine CHTOUROU 2.7, 2.8 and 5.3
-Mariem Mezghanni 5.2
-Yasmine Cheikh 5.1

Of course, it goes without saying that we helped each other out on several occasions and that each one of us tried seperately to solve each of the exercises.
